# Code description

This is an Arduino sketch for an egg incubator using an ESP8266 microcontroller and various sensors. The code uses the Blynk IoT platform for remote monitoring and control. Here is a brief overview of the code:

The code starts with defining the Blynk template ID, name, and authorization token. It also includes the required Blynk and WiFi libraries along with the DHT and Servo libraries.

The code initializes some variables for temperature, humidity, servo position, etc., and sets up the serial communication with the ESP8266.
In the setup function, the WiFi connection is established, and the DHT and Servo sensors are initialized. The pins for the bulb, Servo, and MQ2 sensor are also defined.

The code defines four Blynk virtual pins (V0, V3, V4, and V5), which are used for controlling the servo and turning on/off the sensor data transmission.

The callsensor() function reads the temperature and humidity values from the DHT sensor and updates the Blynk app accordingly. It also turns on/off the bulb based on the temperature value.

The servoin() and servode() functions move the Servo motor back and forth within a 180-degree range. These functions are used in the servo_control() function, which controls the Servo motor based on the values received from the Blynk app.

The read_MQ2_sensor() function reads the MQ2 sensor value and converts it into PPM (parts per million) units. This value is then updated on the Blynk app.

In the loop function, the code checks if the sensor data transmission is enabled through the Blynk app. If it is, it calls the callsensor(), servo_control(), and read_MQ2_sensor() functions. 

The Blynk.syncVirtual() function is used to synchronize the virtual pins between the device and the app, and Blynk.run() is used to handle the communication with the Blynk server.
